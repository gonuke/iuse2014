\section*{Equipment and Other Resources }

This section of the proposal is used to assess the adequacy of the resources available to perform the effort
proposed to satisfy both Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts review criteria. Proposers should describe only
those resources that are directly applicable. Proposers should include an aggregated description of the internal
and external resources (both physical and personnel) that the organization and its collaborators will provide to
the project, should it be funded. Such information must be provided in this section, in lieu of other parts of the
proposal (e.g., budget justification, project description). The description should be narrative in nature and must
not include any quantifiable financial information. Reviewers will evaluate the information during the merit review
process and the cognizant NSF Program Officer will review it for programmatic and technical sufficiency.


Although these resources are not considered cost sharing as defined in 2 CFR section 215.23 (OMB Circular A-110),
the Foundation does expect that the resources identified in the Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources
section will be provided, or made available, should the proposal be funded. AAG Chapter II.B.1 specifies
procedures for use by the awardee when there are postaward changes to objective, scope or methodology.


If there are no Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources to describe, a statement to that effect should
be included in this section of the proposal and uploaded into FastLane.
