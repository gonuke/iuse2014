Scope/Statement of Work

Dr. Ethan White and a graduate student RA will organize and teach one
2-3 day Software Carpentry workshop targeted for students in the
National Science Foundation's Research Experience for Undergraduate
program at the beginning of each summer of the project (2015-2019).
This workshop will teach fundamental scientific computing skills to
these students.  Following the workshop the graduate student will meet
regularly with the undergraduates to provide further training,
technical support, and mentoring with respect to computational methods
and approaches to science.
