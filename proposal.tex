\large\textbf{Summary}

\end{center}

\textbf{Overview:}

Computers are now ubiquitous in scientific research, but many
researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) are still not \emph{computationally competent}: they do
repetitive tasks manually instead of automating them, develop software
haphazardly, and fail to track their work in any systematic,
reproducible way.  This lack of foundational skills impedes their
ability to do research, and prevents them from engaging with new
opportunities in open and web-enabled science.

This project will train STEM undergraduates in these skills, and to
assess the impact of that training on their productivity and career
paths.  We will do this by adapting the workshops run by Software
Carpentry for researchers at the graduate level and above to
undergraduates, and track their alumni over several subsequent years
both to improve the training itself, and to encourage wider adoption
of our model.

More specifically, we will run two-day software skills workshops each
year for five years for undergraduate students taking part in that
year in summer research opportunities such as the NSF's Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, at or near the start of
those students' time in the lab.  We will additionally run at least
one workshop each year specifically aimed at female students, and
another specifically aimed at students from minority groups that are
under-represented in STEM.

Together, these workshops will reach over 2000 students during the
course of the project.  Participants will then serve as the treatment
population for a five-year study by a full-time professional
researcher in educational assessment, who will explore the impact of
this training on their careers in general, and their involvement with
open and web-enabled science in particular.

\textbf{Intellectual merit:}

Our main contribution to knowledge will be an assessment of ways in
which training of this kind can accelerate the careers of participants
and the science they do.  We will discover whether students who
receive this training are more likely than their peers to continue to
graduate school than their peers, to incorporate open science and/or
web-enabled science tools and practices into their work, to choose
computationally oriented research topics and/or careers, and/or to
develop new computational tools and practices.  We will also determine
the extent to which training of this kind changes students' outlook on
the practice of science itself, and whether it can help level the
playing field for women and minorities currently underrepresented in
computing and science.

\textbf {Broader impacts:}

In the medium term, this project will have broader impact through the
creation and dissemination of teaching materials and practices that
other educators and institutions can adopt.  All of the materials
produced by and for this project will be made freely available under
the Creative Commons - Attribution (CC-BY) license, while the results
of our studies of the program's effect will be shared with other
educators through science education journals and conferences.

In the long term, the project's greatest impact will be on scientific
competitiveness.  Computing is no longer optional in any part of
science: even scientists who don't think of themselves as doing
computational work rely on computers to prepare papers, store data,
and collaborate with colleagues.  The better their computing skills
are, the better able they will be to conduct world-class research that
aids national economic competitiveness.

\section{The Problem}

Scientists and engineers invented electronic computers to accelerate
their work, but two generations later, many researchers in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are still not
\emph{computationally competent}: they do repetitive tasks manually
instead of automating them, develop software using a methodology best
summarized as ``copy, paste, tweak, and pray'', and fail to track
their work in any systematic, reproducible way.

While the World-Wide Web was created by a scientist to help his
peers share information, many still use it primarily as a way to find
and download PDFs.  Researchers may understand that open data can fuel
new insights, but often lack the skills needed to create and provide a
reusable data set.  Equally, any discussion of changing scientific
publishing, making research reproducible, or using the web to support
``science as a service'' must eventually address the lack of
pre-requisite skills in the general STEM research community.

Since the mid-1980s (at least), proponents of computational science
have taken an ``if we build it, they will come'' approach to this
problem.  But this learning-by-osmosis approach has not borne fruit:
most faculty would agree that today's graduates are no more able to
use computing and the web \emph{in their research} than they were a
generation ago.  Reasons why ``learning by osmosis'' has not been
effective include:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \emph{The curriculum is full.}  Undergraduate STEM programs already
  struggle to cover material regarded as core to their field.  While
  many scientists would agree that more material on programming,
  reproducible research, or web-enabled science would be useful, there
  is no consensus on what to take out to make room.

\item
  \emph{The blind leading the blind.}  Many faculty lack computational
  skills themselves, and hence are unable to pass them on.

\item
  \emph{Cultural difference.}  Scientists and software developers have
  different priorities and different approaches to problem solving,
  which often impedes collaboration and knowledge transfer
  \cite{segal2005a}.

\item
  \emph{Difficulty of assessing impact.} It is easy to say, ``This
  discovery could not have been made without use of that
  supercomputer.''  It is much harder to attribute specific advances
  in science to prior training in particular methods or techniques,
  particularly ones as young as those that facilitate open and
  web-enabled science.

\end{enumerate}

The final, and possibly largest, issue is that \emph{the rewards are
  unknown}.  Open, web-based science is still in its infancy, so there
is no general understanding of what people might need to know in order
to incorporate it into their research careers.  Since it is hard to
measure something if you don't know what to look for, or if it is so
young that there hasn't actually \emph{been} long-term impact, little
systematic study has been done to date of whether early training in
the skills needed for this new kind of science actually has an impact,
and if so, how and how much.  Without such feedback, there is no
systematic way to improve the training programs that currently exist.

\section{Proposed Work}

This proposal builds on the success to date of the Software Carpentry
workshops in enhancing the skills of graduate students, post-docs, and
faculty.  We propose to:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  conduct formative evaluation of the impact of software skills
  training for undergraduates likely to continue in research careers
  as they progress through the early stages of those careers;

\item
  conduct summative evaluation of the training's overall impact on a
  multi-year timescale in order to improve the content and
  presentation of the training; and

\item
  disseminate the resulting curriculum widely.

\end{enumerate}

We will run software-skills workshops for undergraduate students
taking part each year in summer research opportunities such as the
NSF's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, at or near
the start of those students' time in the lab.  We expect this training
will help them be more productive during their research (graduate-level
participants in our existing workshops typically report that what we
teach saves them a day a week), and also prepare them to work in a
world where all aspects of science are increasingly dependent on
computing.

These undergraduates will serve as the treatment population for a
five-year study of the impact of this training on their careers in
general, and their involvement with open and web-enabled science in
particular.  In order to conduct this study, we will hire an expert in
educational assessment, whose full-time work for the duration of the
project will be to explore the effects of the training on workshop
participants.

\subsection{Workshops}

We will run two-day workshops at a steadily increasing number of sites
each year for four years, timed to coincide with the start of the
summer influx of undergraduate research students.  Each workshop will
be offered to a minimum of 40 learners per site (giving us a target
study population of 1440 students by year 4).  The content will be
tailored to meet local needs, but will be based on what is being used
at that time by Software Carpentry and affiliated educational efforts.
By design, it is straightforward to adapt workshop materials and
contribute changes back to the Software Carpentry organization.  These
features enhance the portability and flexibility of the workshops, and
increase the likelihood of wide dissemination beyond this project.

The home sites for investigators named in this proposal (Michigan
State University, Utah State University, George Washington University,
University of California -- Berkeley, and University of Wisconsin --
Madison) will run workshops in each of those years.  Other sites will
be added each year, increasing the total to 15 in year 5, which
increases the size of our study population.  We will focus expansion
on NSF REU sites \cite{nsfreu}, but as detailed in the next section,
we will also offer some workshops to other communities.

While there is, as mentioned above, considerable scope for customizing
workshops to accommodate learners' prior experience and
discipline-specific needs, a typical workshop devotes roughly half a
day to each of these four topics:

\begin{compactitem}
\item
  the Unix shell;
\item
  version control with Git;
\item
  programming in Python or R; and
\item
  using SQL with databases.
\end{compactitem}

What these workshops actually seek to convey, though, is the best
practices a researcher needs to be \emph{computationally competent}
\cite{wilson2013}:

\begin{compactitem}
\item
  how to automate repetitive tasks;
\item
  how to track and share work over the web;
\item
  how to grow a program in a modular, testable, reusable way; and
\item
  how to create, use, and share structured data.
\end{compactitem}

All of the workshop instructors will have been trained and certified
by Software Carpentry, and will have had experience teaching this
material prior to engaging in this particular workshops.  Just as
importantly, all will themselves be working scientists who use these
skills and concepts daily in their own research, and are therefore
able both to serve as role models and to deal with unanticipated
questions or challenges based on personal experience (e.g.,
\cite{ram2013}).

\subsection{Increasing Diversity}

In order to increase the diversity of the study population, at least
one workshop in each year will be aimed specifically at female
students.  Software Carpentry's first such workshop, held in Boston in
June 2013, attracted 120 participants; its second is scheduled for
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in March 2014, and at least two
more will be held by the time work on this project commences (one in
the United States and one in Europe).  This work will build on that
experience, and draw on the pool of instructors who have gained
mentoring experience through those specific workshops.

Finally, we will organize workshops in years 2--5 specifically aimed
at students from minority groups that are underrepresented in STEM.
We are already in contact with the Computing Alliance for
Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI), and with the Association of
Public and Land-grant Universities' program for historically black
colleges and universities (HBCUs); Software Carpentry is running its
first workshop at an HBCU (Spelman) in early 2014, and we expect to
have expanded these efforts by the start of this project.

\subsection{Assessment}

We will employ an expert in educational assessment full-time for five
years to monitor and compare undergraduate participants in these
workshops, participants in a subset of our regular (graduate-level)
workshops, and non-participants (as a control population).  As part of
their work, this person will be responsible not only for collecting
and analyzing data, but also for refining and extending the methods
and measures used to gauge impact.

Assessment will focus particularly, but not exclusively, on the
following questions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Are students who receive this training more likely to continue to
  graduate school than their peers?

\item
  Are students who receive this training more likely than their peers
  to incorporate open science and/or web-enabled science tools and
  practices into their work?

\item
  Are students who receive this training more likely than their peers
  to choose computationally oriented research topics and/or careers?
  Are those who do not choose computationally oriented paths
  nevertheless more likely to incorporate the tools and practices
  mentioned above into their work?

\item
  Are students who receive this training more likely than their peers
  to develop new tools and practices, and/or become involved in
  outreach and education activities (i.e., are they more likely to
  become creators and leaders)?

\item
  Do outcomes differ between women and underrepresented minorities on
  one hand and non-underrepresented minorities and men on the other?
  If so, in what ways, and what steps are effective in correcting for
  these differences?

\item
  In what ways does this training change students' outlook on the
  practice of science itself?

\end{enumerate}

This researcher will also explore ways in which our engagement with
students changes the outlook and work practices of their peers and
faculty supervisors (i.e., whether there is knowledge transfer
sideways and upward), and at the effectiveness of the community
building and dissemination activities detailed in the next sections.

As with our work to date (discussed below), assessment will use both
qualitative and quantitative techniques.  On the qualitative side, we
will conduct a series of interviews over the five-year period of the
study to see how attitudes, aspirations, and activities change.
Quantitatively, we will measure uptake of key tools such as version
control as a proxy for adoption of related practices, as well as
exploring more traditional measures of research success such as
progression to graduate school and publication/citation rates.

Our findings, and any new methods or measures developed, will be
shared with other researchers through publication in peer-reviewed
journals and high-profile conferences, as discussed below.

\subsection{Community Building}

We will employ one graduate student part-time at each participating
site each year to provide technical support to workshop participants,
and to act as an anchor for a Hacker Within-style grassroots group at
that site.  These community liaisons will not be study subjects, but
will help us stay in touch with students who are (a key requirement
for any longitudinal study).

Separately, the Mozilla Science Lab will focus part of its ongoing
community engagement efforts on the students who have taken part in
our workshops during both the remainder of their undergraduate careers
and afterward in order to ensure that they become part of the broader
open science community.  This may include helping the students
organize and run workshops of their own in subsequent years,
connecting them with other open science projects, introducing them to
potential graduate supervisors who understand and value their new
skills and outlook, etc.

As a subordinate part of their work, the researcher employed by this
project will assess the effectiveness of these local organizers.  In
particular, they will explore whether seeding activity in this way
leads to the formation of self-sustaining grassroots groups, and if
so, what activities those groups develop on their own, how (and how
effectively) they share discoveries with each other, the extent to
which alumni of this program stay engaged with these groups, and
whether the presence of these groups has a demonstrable impact on
students' career paths in general, and their engagement with open and
web-enabled science in particular.

While it will not be feasible to bring all of the students
participating in a given year's workshops together physically, we will
organize and run virtual conferences toward the end of their research
term to give them an opportunity to present their work to one another,
discuss what they have learned, and build peer-to-peer connections.
These conferences will also provide an opportunity to introduce
participants to new forms of scientific ``publishing'', including
blogging, the creation of screencasts and demonstration videos, and
other methods that may not yet exist.

\subsection{Curriculum Development and Dissemination}

We will employ one instructional designer part-time during each of the
study's first four years to create new material, and to improve
existing material based on feedback from workshop participants and the
assessment program.  Here, ``creating material'' may include both
designing and implementing new domain-specific learning modules, and
translating existing materials into new forms, such as video
recordings of lectures or auto-graded quizzes for self-paced
instruction.  This work will be done in consultation with educators at
participating institutions in order to encourage incorporation of
those materials into existing curricula.

All of the materials produced by and for this project will be made
freely available under the Creative Commons -- Attribution (CC-BY)
license.  The instructional designer will work with the Mozilla
Science Lab and affiliated groups to share these materials, and the
results of our studies of the program's impact, through science
education journals, conferences, and other channels. Specifically, we
plan to publish articles in:

\begin{compactitem}

\item
  \emph{Science Education}

\item
  \emph{Physics Education}

\item
  \emph{Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching}

\item
  \emph{American Scientist}

\end{compactitem}

and at the following conferences:

\begin{compactitem}

\item
  the Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) of the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. (ACM)

\item
  the International Conference on Physics Education (ICPE)

\item
  the Association for Biology Laboratory Education (ABLE)

\item
  the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)'s education session at the Joint Mathematics Meeting

\item
  the Education Training and Workforce Development Division's track at the American Nuclear Society (ANS)'s annual meeting

\end{compactitem}

The dissemination of this project's curriculum has strong potential to
be high. Workshop materials are all open access and flexible, thus
they can be readily adopted by others. Adapting workshop materials is
low cost and does not require special equipment. Workshop materials
are structured such that they can scale to the size and application of
interest to a particular group. The Software Carpentry infrastructure
provides support in the form of materials and people. Anyone using
workshop materials can directly contribute changes and feedback, which
both increases buy-in and improves the materials organically. And
finally, local chapters of The Hacker Within create a natural
ecosystem of support for workshop participants, their peers, and
faculty.

As a subordinate part of their work, the researcher employed by this
project will assess the extent to which curriculum developed during
this program is taken up by other educators (particularly those who
think of themselves as scientists first and computationalists second),
and their perception of its utility.  Mid-point results of this
evaluation will be shared with the instructional designer in order to
allow evidence-based improvement of the materials.

\subsection{Project Management}

Prof.\ Slaybaugh will be responsible for overall project management
and reporting.  The educational assessment expert hired by this
project will report directly to her.  Prof.\ Slaybaugh will be
assisted by Dr.\ Huff, who will manage and coordinate the graduate
student assistants at each site.

Dr.\ Wilson and the half-time instructional designer hired by this
project will be responsible for preparation and publication of
learning materials.  Dr.\ Wilson will also provide instructional
training for the graduate student assistants and other participants in
the project on an ongoing basis.

Workshop operations (such as finding instructors and arranging their
travel) will be handled by Mozilla staff who are performing these
duties for the Software Carpentry program more generally.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Theoretical Positioning}

Our theory of action is straightforward: if students are explicitly
taught these skills in a way that makes them seem both useful and
important, they are likely to begin using them in day-to-day work,
which will create a positive feedback cycle leading to them acquiring
more (and more advanced) skills on their own, which in turn will
result in them being more likely to engage in open and web-enabled
scientific activities that would otherwise have been unknown,
incomprehensible, or out of reach.  Using the terminology of
\cite{guidelines}, our work is therefore primarily \emph{design and
  development research}: we are attempting to develop solutions to
achieve related to student engagement and mastery of specific skills,
drawing on existing evidence (from our graduate-level workshops) to
design and iteratively develop interventions, and ready to begin
collecting data on the feasibility of implementing solutions in
typical delivery settings.

\subsection{Research}

Studies of how scientists use computers and the web have found that
most scientists learn what they know about developing software and
using computers and the web in their research through osmosis and word
of mouth \cite{hannay2009,prabhu2011}. In our experience, most
training meant to address this issue:

\begin{compactitem}

\item
  does not target scientists' specific needs (e.g., is a general
  ``Introduction to Computing'' class shared with students majoring in
  other areas);

\item
  only covers the mechanics of programming in a particular language
  rather than giving a complete picture including data management,
  web-enabled publishing, the ``defense in depth'' approach to
  correctness discussed in \cite{dubois2005}, or the other
  foundational skills laid out in \cite{wilson2013}; and/or

\item
  jumps to advanced topics such as parallel computing before
  scientists have mastered the foundations.  (Most research on
  scientific computing, such as \cite{hochstein2005}, does the same.)

\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Software Carpentry}

Software Carpentry \cite{swcsite,wilson2012} is the largest effort to
date to address these issues. Originally created as a training program
at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the late 1990s, it is now part of
the Mozilla Science Lab's efforts to help scientists take advantage of
ways in which the web can change the practice of science today, and
invent new ways tomorrow.  Over 100 certified volunteer instructors
delivered two-day intensive workshops to more than 4200 people in 2013
alone.

Software Carpentry's curriculum and teaching practices have been
refined via iterative design, and are informed by current research on
teaching and learning best practices.  Its instructor-training program
\cite{trainingsite} introduces participants to a variety of modern
teaching techniques (e.g., peer instruction, active learning, and
understanding by design), to concepts underlying these techniques
(e.g., cognitive load theory), and to topic-specific work by computing
education researchers (see \cite{guzdial2010}, \cite{hazzan2011}, and
the first third of \cite{sorva2012} for overviews.)  One example of
how they translate theory into practice is their insistence on live
coding during teaching as a way of demonstrating and transferring
authentic practice to learners.

Software Carpentry has been assessing learning outcomes and retention
since the beginning of its Sloan Foundation funding in January 2012.
The first round of assessment included both qualitative and
quantitative assessment by Dr.\ Jorge Aranda (then at the University
of Victoria) and Prof.\ Julie Libarkin (Michigan State University).

Dr.\ Aranda surveyed and interviewed participants, observed a
workshop, and analyzed screencasts of participants working through a
programming assignment. He found significant increases in
participants' understanding and use of shell commands, version control
tools, Python, and testing techniques. Perhaps more importantly,
participants reported better proficiency with software tools; greater
concern for issues of provenance and code quality; better strategies
to approach software development; and new research questions that have
become accessible thanks to an increase in participants' software
development skills.

Prof.\ Libarkin performed a more detailed assessment of participants
in a workshop held there, which was attended remotely by students from
the University of Texas at Austin. 85\% of participants reported that
they learned what they hoped to learn, 81\% changed their
computational understanding, and 96\% said they would recommend the
workshop to others.

An attempt to scale this up in 2013 was set back by personnel changes,
but systematic follow-ups with past participants in workshops have now
been resumed, and we expect to be able to present preliminary results
by mid-2014.

\subsection{The Hacker Within}

The Hacker Within (THW)\cite{huff2011}, was founded by graduate students in 
nuclear engineering at the University of Wisconsin to provide a forum for 
sharing scientific computing skills and best practices with their peers. As it 
matured as a student organization, it attracted students from many scientific 
disciplines and academic levels. THW conducted bi-weekly seminars and developed 
a series of short courses addressing programming languages C++, Python, and 
Fortran, and best practices such as version control and test-driven code 
development, as well as basic skills such as UNIX mobility. This curriculum was 
delivered primarily as interactive short workshops on campuses and during 
scientific conferences. Many previous founders of the Hacker Within have since 
become instructors with Software Carpentry and a new generation of THW graduate 
students has begun to emerge in their place. In 2013, new branches of THW were 
begun at the University of Melbourne and the University of California - 
Berkeley.  

\section{Broader Impact}

We believe this work will have significant impact in several related
areas.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \emph{Enhance economic competitiveness.} Computing is no longer
  optional in any part of science: even scientists who don't think of
  themselves as doing computational work rely on computers to prepare
  papers, store data, and collaborate with colleagues.  The better
  their computing skills are, the better able they will be to
  contribute to the research that underpins the nation's economic
  competitiveness.

\item
  \emph{Improving STEM education for everyone, not just participants.}
  By creating and validating high-quality open access teaching
  materials, and the methods used to deliver them, this project will
  enable improvement in STEM education for everyone, everywhere, not
  just for participating students and participating institutions.

\item
  \emph{Improving STEM education tomorrow, not just today.}  As noted
  in the introduction of this proposal, most of today's efforts to
  transfer computational skills to STEM researchers and connect them
  with 21st Century innovations in how science is done are flying
  blind: there is effectively no feedback from long-term impact to
  instructional action.  By creating and validating such a feedback
  loop---i.e., by showing scientists how to apply science to their
  teaching---this project will demonstrate how STEM education can be
  continuously improved.

\item
  \emph{Improve participation in STEM by women and underrepresented
    minorities.} The disproportionately low participation of women and
  some minority groups in STEM is well documented, as is the fact that
  computing is one of the least diverse fields within STEM.  This
  second fact creates a vicious circle: people with weaker computing
  skills may be less competitive in research than their peers, which
  reduces their participation in activities viewed as non-core, which
  in turn results in them having weaker skills.  This project will
  strive to break this cycle by giving at-risk students an opportunity
  to ``level up'' in a supportive environment, and by connecting them
  with mentors who can serve as role models.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Career Management Plan}

The graduate students who are serving as mentors for the
undergraduates at the different universities will each be paired with
a local faculty mentor. The faculty mentor will meet regularly with
the graduate student to discuss and problem solve any issues that the
graduate student or undergraduates are having, and to provide active
mentoring on how to train students in computational approaches.

In addition to engaging with the graduate students on their mentoring
of the undergraduates, the faculty mentors will also serve as a
mentors for computational aspects of the graduate students' research
and careers. In many areas of science, computationally-minded students
are located in labs where the PIs do not have strong computational
backgrounds. This means that they do not have a mentor to teach them
about good computational practice in research. In addition, they do
not have someone to discuss computational careers with, thus limiting
their exposure to career paths outside of academia. Because the
faculty mentors will have strong computational backgrounds themselves,
they can fill this void for computationally-minded students.

\section*{Data Management Plan}

\subsection*{Human Subject Data}

This project will collect human subjects data consisting of background
demographics (including age, gender, ethnicity, field of study, and
prior computing experience), career information (including
undergraduate and/or graduate education, publication histories, and
industrial experience), and degree and kind of participation in open
and web-enabled science projects and communities.  This data will be
used to determine what impact the training provided by this project
has on participants' careers and productivity.

The demographic data will be collected from questionnaires and
interviews administered by the PI and student/postdoctoral researchers
associated with this project, and will be entered into an electronic
database.  Since this data will be from human subjects, approval for
human subjects research will be obtained through the University of
California - Berkeley Review Board.  To ensure confidentiality, each
subject will be assigned an arbitrary code, which will be associated
with all data relating to that subject.  One file that contains the
correspondence between subject names and codes will be kept in an
encrypted password-controlled file accessible only to the PI and
assessment researcher.  The de-identified electronic data will be
preserved on DVDs and external hard drives.

If requested, access to the de-identified data will be provided by
contacting the principal investigator. Data will in principle be
available for access and sharing as soon as is reasonably possible,
normally not longer than one year after publication of the data. The
data will be preserved for at least three years beyond the award
period, as required by NSF guidelines.

We do not anticipate that significant intellectual property issues
involved with this data will arise. However, in the event that
discoveries or inventions are made in direct connection with these
data, access to the data will be granted upon request once appropriate
invention disclosures and/or provisional patent filings are made.  The
data acquired and preserved in the context of this proposal will be
further governed by the University of California - Berkeley's policies
pertaining to intellectual property, record retention, and data
management.

\subsection*{Educational Materials}

All of the educational materials produced by and for this project will
be made freely available under the Creative Commons -- Attribution
(CC-BY) license.  These materials will be placed in a publicly
accessible version control repository, and also made available for
download from the Software Carpentry web site in widely-used formats,
including (but not limited to) HTML pages, PDF documents, and slide
decks compatible with common presentation tools.  Authorship and
contribution will be tracked to ensure that contributors are credited
for their work.  If participating institutions show sufficient
interest, we shall also provide materials in formats compatible with
current and emerging e-learning standards such as SCORM and the
Experience API.
